# 🧹 Intelligent Data Cleaning Assistant

> An AI-powered data cleaning platform designed specifically for statistical agencies and data professionals to streamline survey data preprocessing with column-specific recommendations and comprehensive audit trails.


## 🎯 Problem Statement

Statistical agencies and data scientists spend up to 80% of their time cleaning and preparing data. Traditional tools either:
- Provide generic, one-size-fits-all solutions that ignore column-specific characteristics
- Lack transparency in cleaning operations, making it hard to maintain audit trails
- Don't consider survey methodology and sampling weights
- Require extensive programming knowledge

**Our solution**: An intelligent, context-aware data cleaning assistant that analyzes each column individually and provides tailored recommendations while maintaining complete transparency and statistical rigor.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Column-Specific Intelligence
- **Individual Column Analysis**: Each column is analyzed separately based on its unique characteristics (data type, distribution, missing patterns)
- **Context-Aware Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions tailored to specific data issues detected in each column
- **Smart Type Detection**: Automatically identifies numeric, categorical, binary, ordinal, and text columns

### 🤖 AI-Powered Assistance
- **Conversational Interface**: Ask questions about your data and get expert-level guidance
- **Method Comparison**: Compare different cleaning strategies with pros/cons for your specific use case
- **Impact Assessment**: Understand how each cleaning operation will affect your data and analysis
- **Educational Explanations**: Learn statistical concepts as you clean your data

### 🔧 Comprehensive Cleaning Tools

#### Missing Value Handling
- Mean/Median/Mode Imputation
- Forward/Backward Fill
- KNN Imputation
- Interpolation methods
- Deletion strategies (listwise/pairwise)

#### Outlier Detection & Treatment
- Multiple detection methods (IQR, Z-score, Modified Z-score, Isolation Forest)
- Consensus-based outlier identification
- Treatment options: removal, winsorization, capping, transformation

#### Data Quality Assessment
- Automated quality scoring (0-100)
- Issue detection and prioritization
- Pattern recognition in missing data
- Distribution analysis (skewness, kurtosis)

### 📊 Advanced Capabilities
- **Survey Weights Integration**: Properly handle sampling weights in cleaning operations
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Complete audit trail with ability to revert operations
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Distribution plots, outlier detection, correlation analysis
- **PDF Report Generation**: Comprehensive documentation of all cleaning operations
- **Configuration Export/Import**: Save and reuse cleaning workflows
