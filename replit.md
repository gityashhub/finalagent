## Environment Setup
The application is configured to run on Replit with:
- Python 3.11
- All dependencies managed via uv (see pyproject.toml)
- Streamlit server on port 5000 with proper CORS configuration

## Configuration
The Streamlit app is configured to:
- Listen on 0.0.0.0:5000 (required for Replit proxy)
- Disable CORS and XSRF protection for Replit environment
- Run in headless mode for server deployment

## AI Assistant Configuration
The AI assistant requires a GROQ_API_KEY environment variable to be set. Without this key, the AI features will not be available, but all other functionality will work normally.

## Deployment
The application is configured for autoscale deployment, suitable for stateless web applications. It automatically scales based on traffic and stops when not in use.

## User Preferences
None configured yet.

## Notes
- The application uses a virtual environment (.pythonlibs/) for dependency isolation
- Data files (CSV, Excel) are gitignored to protect sensitive survey data
- The app supports weighted and unweighted statistical analysis
